<p>This project is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy">selfspy</a>. We have modified the original project for research purposes by developing it into a Mac Application that captures additional, invasive information such as screenshots, document names and in the future, webcam pictures.</p>

<p>Even though we keep most of the multi-platform code of the original selfspy, we're are not actively maintaining compatiblity with Unix/X11 and Windows. We are also working on advanced visualizations tools for the data and disabled for the statistics part of selfspy in the process of generating an application.</p>

<p>Since Selfspy takes regular screenshots it can fill your hard drive pretty quickly. We recommend setting your Data storage to an external drive, such as a USB key or SD card. Simply copy the <code>selfspy.cfg</code> file to the root of your desired data storage volume and mount the device onto your computer. Selfspy will recognize the volume and save its data there.</p>

<p>Selfspy is a daemon Mac OS X that continuously monitors and stores what you are doing on your computer. It was originally inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">Quantified Self</a>-movement and <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">Stephen Wolfram's personal key logging</a>.</p>

<a id="installing-selfspy" class="anchor" href="#installing-selfspy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing Selfspy</h3>

<p>We keep a compiled Mac OS X app in Releases, so go ahead and download it.</p>

<p>To install manually, either clone the repository from Github (git clone git://github.com/aurelient/selfspy), or click on the Download link on <a href="http://github.com/aurelient/selfspy/">http://github.com/aurelient/selfspy/</a> to get the latest Python source.</p>

<p>With 10.9 you should do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you do not have xcode installed, do it now. If you did not agree to its license agreement yet, do it know (e.g. by starting it.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not have brew installed yet, do it now.</p></li>
<li><p>brew install python</p></li>
<li><p>brew doctor
This will tell you modify your path with a oneliner. Do this. Then, open a new terminal session.</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/aurelient/selfspy
cd selfspy
pip install setuptools==3.4.1 &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py py2app
</code></pre>

<p>A note on VirtualEnvs:</p>

<p>If you want to run the installation within a virtual environment, the file $PROJECT_ROOT/py2app-0.9-py2.7.egg/py2app/recipes/virtualenv.py</p>

<p>has to be manually edited such that the functions that line 52 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>m = mf._load_module(m.identifier, fp, pathname, stuff)
</code></pre>

<p>and line 81 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    mf._scan_code(co, m)
</code></pre>

<p>(Yes, this is only adding two underscores.)</p>

<p>This command sequence will build an .app in the /dist folder of your selfspy directory.</p>

<p>Selfspy is only tested with Python 2.7 and has a few dependencies on other Python libraries that need to be satisfied. These are documented in the requirements.txt file.</p>

<a id="running-on-os-x" class="anchor" href="#running-on-os-x" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running on OS X</h4>

<p>To run Selfspy in OS X you also need to enable access for assistive devices.
To do that in &lt;10.9 there is a checkbox in <code>System Preferences &gt; Accessibility</code>,
in 10.9 you have to add the correct application in
<code>System Preferences &gt; Privacy &gt; Accessability</code>.</p>

<p>You may also want to grant Full Keyboard Access to All Controls in <code>system Preference &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts</code> to make it easier to tab through Selfspy's windows.</p>
